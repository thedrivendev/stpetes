This newly formed fishery is surrounded by a marine park and offers an enormous and expansive system of flats, lagoons and pristine estuaries. Virtually untouched, this fishing location represents one of the cleanest and most biologically diverse ecosystems providing opportunities for catching bonefish, permit, tarpon, snook, and barracuda. The flats are an inviting combination of hard packed white sand and a semi-firm mottled bottom great for wade fishing. Spend the day wading or boat fishing the flats and then return to the  hotel for some rest and relaxation.<\/p>"

The flats are an inviting combination of hard packed white sand and a semi-firm mottled bottom that still provides good wading. And what a place this is for those who like to wade! It‘s very similar to Los Roques in terms of the amount of area that‘s wadable and there are places here where you can wade for 4 straight hours without heading back to the boat.<\/p>",
