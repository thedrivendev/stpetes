A more laid back and friendly approach to guiding makes a day fishing with Ryan a positive experience that he hopes will leave his guests with a better understanding of the sport and the water we are lucky enough to enjoy.<\/p>",

He holds<br\/>the belief that when one immerses themselves in nature, they learn not just about plants,<br\/>animals and landscape, but more importantly about oneself. Josh is at home in the<br\/>woods, and hunting wild fish with a fly rod is a perfect fit. Fly fishing is definitely a<br\/>lifestyle for him.<\/p><p>Wading Colorado’s rivers, rowing bigger waters in Wyoming, hiking to high<br\/>mountain lakes and tying flies are ways Josh is always trying to learn more. He stays<br\/>thoroughly embedded in fish up to his gills and would have it no other way!<\/p><p>Becoming a guide seemed inevitable in Josh’s life. He loves to share his<br\/>knowledge about trout and their ecosystem. His passion for guiding is obvious with a<br\/>day spent on the water with him. “Sharing these amazing places and beautiful fish with<br\/>people is a dream come true for me! Seeing people connect with their natural<br\/>environment and the experience it gives them is my motivation each day.” -Josh<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/joshtheflyfishingguide\/\"><strong>Click Here to see Josh's Instagram Page<\/strong><\/a><\/p>",

            "text": "<p>Luke grew up fishing and hunting in Tennessee. Since relocating to Northern Colorado in 2016, he has fallen into a seasonal rhythm with the water. Spending his off-season skiing in the high country before heading back down the hill with the snowpack each spring to dust off the oars and get back on the river. While Luke is especially fond of presenting dry flies to trout on the rise, he is no purist and his southern upbringing left him with a soft spot for split shot and indicators. He brings a mountaineering approach to group dynamics and risk management on the water and is grateful to be able to share special moments in the backcountry with his friends and clients.<\/p>",
