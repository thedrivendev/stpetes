The Tsimane experience is unique, not only due to the location, it is a fishery that has been developed to create a sustainable angling model. To achieve this, Tsimane works in collaboration with the indigenous cultures to protect the unique fishery in a pristine environment. The Pluma lodge is a very comfortable jungle lodge built from sustainable wood cut from the nearby jungle. The lodge features 5 double rooms with private bathrooms, accommodating 7 anglers perfectly.<\/p>"
